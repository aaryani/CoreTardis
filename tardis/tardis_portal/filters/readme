The exif.py filter is not used anywhere in mytardis apart from its unit tests in
tardis_portal/tests/test_filters.py.

This filter used to use pyexiv2.py to extract image metadata from image files. 
The pyexiv2 was replaced by EXIF.py (http://exif-py.sourceforge.net/) because it
can't be installed with buildout. 

The filter is considered as deadcode on this stage because it hasn't been used 
yet.
